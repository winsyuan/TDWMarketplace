# TDW Market

## Project Description
This is a marketplace app which allows: 
- Users to login through google provider
- Users to list items for sale, specify more details about the item
- Sellers to create live bidding sessions in a video call

## Concepts to be used for Challenge Factor
- `OAuth 2.0` - Users are able to sign in to our application using other oauth providers such as Google and authorization for multiple scopes such as access to their google calendar 
- `Real-time interaction` - Sellers would be able to host live bidding sessions with a video chat where they can disconnect all the other users in the video call 
- `Workers` - Utilize workers in backend to send emails three minutes after signing up, and for setting the event in their google calendar 

## Key features to be completed by the beta version
- Plan on getting `OAuth 2.0` to authenticate users to login to our application 
- Live video bidding sessions
- Functional and working UI
- Users can add new items to sell and view others items put for sale

## Additional features to be completed by final version
- Enhance the UI with library components such as Tailwind CSS

- Live video sessions can allow users to be disconnected
- Deploy web application in a digital ocean vm
